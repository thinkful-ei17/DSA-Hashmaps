Any permutation a palindrome
Write an algorithm to check whether any permutation of a string is a palindrome. Given the string "acecarr", the algorithm should return true, because the letters in "acecarr" can be rearranged to "racecar", which is a palindrome. In contrast, given the word "north", the algorithm should return false, because there's no way to rearrange those letters to be a palindrome.

Anagram grouping
Write an algorithm to group a list of words into anagrams. For example, if the input was ['east', 'cars', 'acre', 'arcs', 'teas', 'eats', 'race'], the output should be: [['east', 'teas', 'eats'], ['cars', 'arcs'], ['acre', 'race']].

Separate Chaining
Write a hash map implementation like the one you have done above using separate chaining as collision resolution mechanism.

Test your hash map with the same value from before.
